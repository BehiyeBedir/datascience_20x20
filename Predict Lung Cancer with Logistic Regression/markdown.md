# Predicting Lung Cancer Risk Using Logistic Regression

## üìå Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.  
Early detection plays a critical role in improving patient survival rates.  

In this mini-project, we develop a **Logistic Regression** model to predict the risk of lung cancer based on patient symptoms and lifestyle factors.

The dataset contains patient information such as age, gender, smoking habits, and common symptoms.  
Our goal is to train a model that estimates the probability of a patient having lung cancer, helping to identify high-risk individuals for further screening.
