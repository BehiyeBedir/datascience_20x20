# Predicting Life Expectancy: A Random Forest Approach

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict life expectancy based on various health, economic, and social factors using a Random Forest regression model. The dataset includes data from 193 countries spanning the years 2000 to 2015, covering critical variables such as immunization rates, mortality statistics, income composition, and healthcare expenditures.

By analyzing these factors and visualizing their relationships with life expectancy, we seek to understand the key drivers behind differences in lifespan across countries. The modelâ€™s strong performance indicates that these features collectively provide valuable insights into the determinants of life expectancy.

This study also highlights the importance of socioeconomic and healthcare access variables, emphasizing that improving life expectancy requires a multi-faceted approach beyond simple economic growth.
